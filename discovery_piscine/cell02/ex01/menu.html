    <h1>A train leaves Paris for Lyon, Saturday September 12th 1985, day of a lunar eclipse.
        It will ride at 216 km/h, the wind blows S/SE at a factor 5, and the temperature outside
        the train is 13 degree Celsius, and 22°C inside. The sky is cloudy. Another train leaves
        Lyon for Paris, on the same day at 23:00. It is riding at 224km/h. Which one of these
        two train will be the furthest away from Paris when they will cross path?
        While you mull over the question, have a SNCF ham and cheese sandwich commonly
        referred as “Drop-down menu”.<br><br>
